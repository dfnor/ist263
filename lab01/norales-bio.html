    <body>
        My name is Dexter Norales. I am currently an IMT major and am interested in coding cool projects. I’ve launched my website this summer, paidintoken.com. That’s my biggest and most relevant accomplishment right now. Outside of work, I enjoy spending my time in SoHo, New York. I enjoy trying foods that the city has to offer. I also enjoy playing basketball.
