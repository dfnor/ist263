            <h1>Dexter Norales' Biography</h1>
            <h2>Personal Info</h2>
            <p>My name is Dexter Norales. I am currently an IMT major and am interested in coding cool projects. I launched my website this summer, <strong>paidintoken.com</strong>. Thatâ€™s my biggest and most relevant accomplishment right now. Outside of work, I enjoy spending my time in SoHo, New York. I enjoy trying foods that the city has to offer. I also enjoy playing basketball. </p>
