            <b>Personal Projects: </b> Has information on projects I've worked on such as my automation bots for Supreme, Facebook, and Eric Emanuel. There is also significant depth about my project PaidinToken. It is my largest project to date and contains the elements of that story.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Internship Experience: </b> Shares the information about my time at Stacker. It is my internship that I've grown a lot through. I've learned new ways to use Python and have used it to my advantage in my future projects. This is virtually how I've gained the skills that I advertise today. An interesting read!
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>About Me: </b> Consists of an in depth view of who I am. There is deeper insight on how my love for science, math, and coding came to be. The story introduces elements from my elementary school years. Feel free to read!
