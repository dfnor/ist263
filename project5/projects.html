        In 2022, I worked for The Hustle Presents, Stacker Media, and for myself. In regard to working for myself, I wanted to launch a website that would satisfy my interest in knowing about the current value of investments that many celebrities made with crypto. Many of these payments were over $100,000! It was especially interesting to me to see whether these payments would be profitable or losses for the celebrities that made them. So, on my free time, I would start to ideate first on who I wanted to include on my listen, what research would be needed, and what resources I would use. I then started to build the backend which got the live price of bitcoin and sent it to me for me to manipulate to get new stats I then set up the domain to be safe for users to use (HTTPS) I then made the front end look appealing and launched in August! Click though to see some pictures of the project.
